# **CPU Monitor** 
How much energy is cost by your CPU?

CPU Monitor is the course projection on `Green Tech`. 
We expect strong linear correlations between power consumption
and CPU load like following formula.

![N|Formula](https://github.com/nightheronry/CPUMonitor/blob/master/Formula.png)

So we calculate the correlation coefficient *a* and *b* via power consumption knowing from `power meter` and CPU loading getting by Java `OperatingSystemMXBean API`.
